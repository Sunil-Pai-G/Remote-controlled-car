# Remote-controlled-car
Built a remote control car using IR sensors,Arduino UNO and a TV remote.

Wrote the code in Arduino CC by capturing the frrequncy of Infra Red light emitted by the T.V remote.
The car could move in any direction and also had a collision detection system which was accomplished using an Ultrsonic sensor
